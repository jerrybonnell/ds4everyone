# Data Science

Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data sets through exploration, prediction, and inference. Exploration involves identifying patterns in information. Prediction involves using information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew. Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the patterns that we found in our data also appear in new observations? How accurate are our predictions? Our primary tools for exploration are visualizations and descriptive statistics, for prediction are machine learning and optimization, and for inference are statistical tests and models.

Statistics is a central component of data science because statistics studies how to make robust conclusions based on incomplete information. Computing is a central component because programming allows us to apply analysis techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in real-world applications: not just numbers, but text, images, videos, and sensor readings. Data science is all of these things, but it is more than the sum of its parts because of the applications. Through understanding a particular domain, data scientists learn to ask appropriate questions about their data and correctly interpret the answers provided by our inferential and computational tools.

## Introduction

Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three, introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that can be applied to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data science requires not only understanding statistical and computational techniques, but also recognizing how they apply to real scenarios.

For whatever aspect of the world we wish to study—whether it's the Earth's weather, the world's markets, political polls, or the human mind—data we collect typically offer an incomplete description of the subject at hand. A central challenge of data science is to make reliable conclusions using this partial information.

In this endeavor, we will combine two essential tools: computation and randomization. For example, we may want to understand climate change trends using temperature observations. Computers will allow us to use all available information to draw conclusions. Rather than focusing only on the average temperature of a region, we will consider the whole range of temperatures together to construct a more nuanced analysis. Randomness will allow us to consider the many different ways in which incomplete information might be completed. Rather than assuming that temperatures vary in a particular way, we will learn to use randomness as a way to imagine many possible scenarios that are all consistent with the data we observe.

Applying this approach requires learning to program a computer, and so this text interleaves a complete introduction to programming that assumes no prior knowledge. Readers with programming experience will find that we cover several topics in computation that do not appear in a typical introductory computer science curriculum. Data science also requires careful reasoning about numerical quantities, but this text does not assume any background in mathematics or statistics beyond basic algebra. You will find very few equations in this text. Instead, techniques are described to readers in the same language in which they are described to the computers that execute them—a programming language.

### Computational Tools 

This text uses the Python 3 programming language, along with a standard set of numerical and data visualization tools that are used widely in commercial applications, scientific experiments, and open-source projects. Python has recruited enthusiasts from many professions that use data to draw conclusions. By learning the Python language, you will join a million-person-strong community of software developers and data scientists.

__Getting Started.__ The easiest and recommended way to start writing programs in Python is to log into the companion site for this text, datahub.berkeley.edu. If you have a @berkeley.edu email address, you already have full access to the programming environment hosted on that site. If not, please complete this form to request access.

You are not at all restricted to using this web-based programming environment. A Python program can be executed by any computer, regardless of its manufacturer or operating system, provided that support for the language is installed. If you wish to install the version of Python and its accompanying libraries that will match this text, we recommend the Anaconda distribution that packages together the Python 3 language interpreter, IPython libraries, and the Jupyter notebook environment.

This text includes a complete introduction to all of these computational tools. You will learn to write programs, generate images from data, and work with real-world data sets that are published online.

### Statistical Techniques 

The discipline of statistics has long addressed the same fundamental challenge as data science: how to draw robust conclusions about the world using incomplete information. One of the most important contributions of statistics is a consistent and precise vocabulary for describing the relationship between observations and conclusions. This text continues in the same tradition, focusing on a set of core inferential problems from statistics: testing hypotheses, estimating confidence, and predicting unknown quantities.

Data science extends the field of statistics by taking full advantage of computing, data visualization, machine learning, optimization, and access to information. The combination of fast computers and the Internet gives anyone the ability to access and analyze vast datasets: millions of news articles, full encyclopedias, databases for any domain, and massive repositories of music, photos, and video.

Applications to real data sets motivate the statistical techniques that we describe throughout the text. Real data often do not follow regular patterns or match standard equations. The interesting variation in real data can be lost by focusing too much attention on simplistic summaries such as average values. Computers enable a family of methods based on resampling that apply to a wide range of different inference problems, take into account all available information, and require few assumptions or conditions. Although these techniques have often been reserved for advanced courses in statistics, their flexibility and simplicity are a natural fit for data science applications.
