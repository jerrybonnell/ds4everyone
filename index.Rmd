# Welcome {-}

This is the first edition of "Exploring Data Science with R and the Tidyverse: A Concise Introduction", published by CRC Press. 

This textbook was used to teach the courses *Data Science for the World* (CSC100) and *Introduction to Data Science in R* (CSC200) at the University of Miami in Fall 2021 and Fall 2022.

__Colophon__

This book was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The accompanying website is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and built from [source](https://github.com/jerrybonnell/ds4everyone) by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). It is made freely available to interested readers at https://ds4world.cs.miami.edu/. 

This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string` and the following packages:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
pkgs <- sort(deps$package)
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```
